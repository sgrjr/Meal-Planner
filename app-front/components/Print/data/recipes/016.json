Divide slaw among 4 plates; top each serving with 1 chicken cutlet. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and onions."

	"note": "This was excellent with some adjustments (I think as is I would rate it 3 or 4 stars). Here are the adjustments: First off, I added three chopped up celery sticks. Also, taking the advice of the other reviewer, I doubled up on the sauce by adding an extra cup of chicken broth towards the end and just a little more cornstarch for the extra broth (appx 1 tsp extra), and a couple dashes (appx 1 tbsp) of rice wine vinegar as the veggies were steaming. After taking out the kids' portions, I added extra Asian Garlic Chili sauce for a little more heat/flavor, and served over brown rice. I think it would have been too dry without the extra sauce. It was excellent with these changes."
